# Personal Expense Tracker - Technical Documentation

## Overview

The Personal Expense Tracker is a command-line application written in Python that provides a simple yet comprehensive solution for managing personal finances. The application follows a clean, modular architecture with separated concerns for data management and user interface, making it easy to maintain and extend.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. ExpenseManager Class
The `ExpenseManager` class serves as the data layer and business logic component of the application. It handles all expense-related operations including:

- **Data Persistence**: Automatic loading and saving of expenses to a JSON file
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for expenses
- **Data Validation**: Ensures data integrity and validates user inputs
- **Data Analysis**: Provides summary statistics and category-based breakdowns

**Key Methods:**
- `load_expenses()`: Loads expense data from JSON file on startup
- `save_expenses()`: Persists current expense data to JSON file
- `add_expense()`: Creates new expense entries with unique IDs
- `delete_expense()`: Removes expenses by ID
- `get_summary()`: Generates comprehensive expense statistics
- `validate_expense()`: Validates expense data before processing

#### 2. ExpenseTrackerCLI Class
The `ExpenseTrackerCLI` class handles all user interface interactions and provides a clean, intuitive command-line experience. It implements a menu-driven interface with the following features:

- **Interactive Menus**: Clear, numbered options for all operations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of user errors and edge cases
- **Data Display**: Formatted output for expense lists and summaries
- **CSV Integration**: Import and export functionality for data portability

## Feature Set

### 1. Add Expense
**Menu Option**: "Add expense"

The application provides two methods for adding expenses:

**Data Model:**
```python
{
    "id": "unique_8_char_string",
    "amount": float,
    "category": "string",
    "description": "string", 
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "created_at": "ISO_timestamp"
